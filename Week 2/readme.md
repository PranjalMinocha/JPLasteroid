#### Week 2: `8 Aug,22` - `14 Aug,22`
* Perform basic EDA (discover patterns, handle Null/NaN and outliers)
* Dig deep into features in the JPL dataset (characteristics of an asteroid) and understand which ones could be helpful in estimating diameter.
* Try some complex plots (heatmaps, histograms, boxplots) to gain more insights
* Learn about feature selection and feature engineering
```
