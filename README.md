# Asteroid Diameter Prediction using ML/DL techniques
> PaAC Open Projects Autumn'2022

### Problem Statement
The diameter of an asteroid is one the most important physical parameter of an asteroid, it is used to detect if an asteroid is potentially hazardous or not if it is found to be a Near Earth Object. We aim to train a ML/DL model on JPL asteroid database to predict asteroid diameter.

### Solution
* Get a clear idea where Machine Learning can help in solving the problem
* Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of the dataset and choose a suitable ML model (Regression)
* Clean and prepare dataset for training
* Split dataset into train-validation-test sets. Try cross-validation
* Train and evaluate model performance by choosing suitable metrics (r2-score)
* Tune hyper-parameters to get better results
* Present inferences and results
