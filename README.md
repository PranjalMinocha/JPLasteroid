# Asteroid Diameter Prediction using ML/DL techniques
> PaAC Open Projects Autumn'2022

### Problem Statement
The diameter of an asteroid is one the most important physical parameter of an asteroid, it is used to detect if an asteroid is potentially hazardous or not if it is found to be a Near Earth Object. We aim to train a ML/DL model on JPL asteroid database to predict asteroid diameter.
